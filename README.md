XbmcSwitch
==========

Run an external switch to start/stop a program on linux - in this case XBMC on a headless linux box.


Installation
------------

The `XbmcSwitch.ino` file needs to be flashed on to your Arduino, and then on the server side you'll want to symlink the `config/XbmcSwitch.init` script to `/etc/init.d/XbmcSwitch`. Then you can start the app with `/etc/init.d/XbmcSwitch start`.

I recommend creating a virtualenv for the app, and installing pySerial as specified in `config/requirements.txt`. Otherwise you could install pySerial globally on your system and modify `DAEMON` as specified below.

A couple of variables will need changing in the init script for your setup:

 * `DAEMON` is the path to the Python binary running this app. It may be /usr/bin/python or a virtualenv specific one like mine.
 * `DAEMON_OPTS` is the path to the `arduino_serial_comms.py` script.

The `arduino_serial_comms.py` script does all the hard work on the server, and has a few globals you will want to edit:

 * `SERIAL_PORT` is the path to serial comms port. Note the {0} place holder which will be filled with either 0 or 1 at runtime.
 * `PROC_NAME` is the name of the running process which the switch controls. This value is grepped for in `ps`.
 * `INIT_SCRIPT_NAME` is the init script which starts `PROC_NAME`.
 * `LOG_FILE` is the location of the scripts logging. You'll want to change this.
 * `LOG_LEVEL` may be set to `logging.INFO` after successful setup.


Extra System Configuration
--------------------------

I modified my XBMC start script to [create its pid file in a directory owned by my user](http://serverfault.com/questions/159334/what-permission-to-write-pid-file-in-var-run) (which runs the `arduino_serial_comms.py` script).

    # Path of the PID file
    PID_FILE=/var/run/xbmc/xbmc.pid
    if [ ! -d /var/run/xbmc ]; then
        mkdir /var/run/xbmc    
        /bin/chown mafro:mafro /var/run/xbmc    
        /bin/chmod 755 /var/run/xbmc    
    fi
